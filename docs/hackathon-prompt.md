# Hackathon Prompt: Lexi-Cut

## The Problem

Creators spend:

- 30 minutes scripting a short video
- 30 minutes recording it
- **4+ hours editing it**

Editing becomes the bottleneck, especially for beginners, and often stops them from posting altogether.

## What We're Looking For

A single page video editor for short talking-head content (Reels, TikTok, Shorts). Think **Adobe Premiere power** with **iPhone Notes simplicity**.

- Upload **3–5 short form video clips**
- Automatically assemble a **cohesive**, good-looking first cut
- Provide a **minimal UI** for quick fine-tuning

## Core Functionality

These are the essentials, the foundation your project should cover:

| Component | What It Should Do |
| --- | --- |
| **Upload & Import** | Drag-and-drop 3–5 short video clips (MOV/MP4) |
| **Transcript Generation** | Auto-extract and merge a clean transcript from all clips |
| **Timeline Auto-Stitching** | Auto-construct a first cut with natural flow |
| **Script-Driven Editing** | Change the text → change the video |
| **Manual Controls** | Drag clips, reorder, trim, adjust transitions |
| **Social-Ready Preview** | Vertical video output (Reels/TikTok/Shorts-ready) |

## Take It Further

This is where you make it yours. Some ideas to spark creativity:

- Subtitles automatically synced
- Jump-cut smoothing + reframing
- Voice cleanup (noise reduction, loudness leveling)

**We want to see your ideas. The core features are a starting point, not a ceiling. If you've got a vision for how this could be even better, build it.**

## Judging Criteria

### The Bar

Your app needs to nail two things:

1. **Cohesion of Speech:** Multiple clips should feel like one clean take
2. **Clarity of Delivery:** Perfect lip-sync, clean transcript, seamless edits

Editing should feel like editing text. The video just follows.

### The Flow

A clear, functional single-page experience:

**Upload → Auto-Edit → Fine-Tune → Export**

Use whatever stack you want. It just needs to work reliably end-to-end.

### The Test

It will be room based judging where your team pitches your product to a panel of judges who will evaluate and score based on functionality, creativity, and adherence to the set requirements.

The six highest scoring entries will move on to the next stage, where we have 3 real Stanley Creators evaluate the finalists by:

1. Upload their raw talking head clips
2. Edit a short video using your tool
3. Rate the experience

We will select the winner based on:

- How much they **liked the user experience**
- How likely they'd use this editor again

The submission that **Creators love the most** wins.
